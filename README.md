## About the Project

SWIPR was built as part of our Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and User Experience (UX) design course. The project focuses on solving the problem faced by creatives struggling to find reliable and verified collaborators. Unlike traditional social media platforms, SWIPR provides a structured environment for networking, project planning, and communication.

## UX Design Process

Our development followed a user-centered design approach:
1. Wireframe Creation — Focus on functional layout and core flows.
2. Colored Prototype — Added branding, color palette, and visual hierarchy.
3. Final Implementation — Fully functional Android application with polished UI components, responsive design, and accessibility considerations.

We applied key HCI principles:
- Simplicity & Clarity
- Consistency Across Screens
- User Control & Freedom
- Immediate Feedback
- Error Prevention
